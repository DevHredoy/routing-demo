in this branch nested routing and indexing has been done .In nested routing there will be more nav other than the top nav of page in a particular
page. the url will also effected. that means the parent route is properly arranged under a parent route in url.

useSearch params:this hook is used to use filter. In websites we can filter search results.
this hook is used to modify the url.

relative links: if we use relative link in the url the parent directory link doesn't appear
rather only that route's path appears. for example in absolute links it is 

              :localhost:3000/products/new
              

but in relative link it becomes:

                :localhost:3000/new

relative links are useful when there is a problem of nested routing has.



lazyload: during intial rendering we can skip some rendering and that will take place later when we shall need.
